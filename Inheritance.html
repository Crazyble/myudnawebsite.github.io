        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>
            Inheritance is the practice of receiving private property, titles, debts, entitlements, privileges, rights,
            and
            obligations upon the death of an individual. The rules of inheritance differ among societies and have
            changed over time.
            Officially bequeathing private property and/or debts can be performed by a testator via will, as attested by
            a notary or
            by other lawful means.
